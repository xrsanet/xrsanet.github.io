      <description>This Blog is created and updated with the same processes outlined here. I will explain how you can create your own Blog using Hugo, Github Pages (Custom Domain) with CI/CD using CircleCI and fronted by Cloudflare.
Static websites have many advantages over their dynamic counterparts, to list a few:
 More secure due to them being pure HTML/CSS, no dynamic rendering Faster to load and cache with CDNs Do not require a Server or Database Can be hosted using S3 Buckets, Github/Gitlab Pages  Step 1 - Creating Hugo Site/Files This is a popular open-source static site generator.</description>

      <title>CTDB Glusterfs NFS Event Monitor Script</title>

      <description>There is no CTDB monitor script for the GlusterFS NFS implementation as you cannot use the normal NFS event script that comes with CTDB, this is because GlusterFS manages NFS.
Without a proper monitoring script CTDB will not initiate a failover when NFS services fail, below I have created a script to solve this problem.
Code #!/bin/sh # Event script to monitor GlusterFS NFS in a cluster environment # Source: https://xrsa.</description>

      <description>Below are simple step by step instructions for installing the node and getting it configured for the hosted engine using CentOS 7.
Installation Requirements  Installing Hosted Engine on CentOS 7 requires oVirt 3.5.1 Both the node and engine will be running CentOS 7 (Minimal Installation) Ensure the host is fully updated via yum update and rebooted before proceeding  Prerequisites DNS
Ensure you have set up hostnames for the host and engine.</description>

      <title>Running VMware ESXi Under Ovirt 3.5</title>

      <description>Getting VMware ESXi to install and run properly under oVirt was an interesting experience. However, it does require patching Qemu.
Please note: I am assuming your oVirt host is Fedora 20. You may skip Step 1 if you have already installed my patched RPMS. However, read on if your curious why the patches are needed.
Step 1 â€“ Patching Qemu Current SRPM for patching Qemu is here: qemu-1.6.2-7.fc20.src.rpm
Please note: I am using the SRPM from the Fedora repository instead of the latest source from Qemu.</description>
